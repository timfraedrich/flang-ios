# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy sets out how the iOS app "Flang" uses and protects your personal data that you provide, or that is otherwise obtained or generated.

## Data Stored Locally on Your Device

The following data is stored locally on your iOS device and is never transmitted to any server:

- **Tutorial completion status** - Stored in UserDefaults to track whether you have completed the tutorial
- **Session authentication key** - When you create an account, your session credentials are stored securely in iOS Keychain with hardware-level encryption to keep you logged in

When you use Flang in offline mode (local games without an account), NO personal information is collected or transmitted.

## Online Features and Data Sharing

When you create an account and use online features, your data is transmitted to and stored on servers operated by **Jannis Scheibe** (the creator of Flang). By creating an account, you acknowledge and consent to sharing your data with Jannis Scheibe for the purpose of providing these online features.

**Online features include:**
- Creating an account and logging in
- Playing and viewing online games
- Viewing leaderboards and player rankings
- Searching for and viewing other players' profiles and statistics
- Accessing your game history and ratings

For all data collection, storage, usage, and deletion related to online features, please refer to [the official Flang Privacy Policy](https://codeberg.org/jannis/Flang/src/branch/master/PRIVACY.md). This includes information about what data is collected by the server, how it is used, how it is protected, and how to request deletion of your account and data.

## Security

Your password is cryptographically hashed on your device before transmission and is never sent or stored in plaintext.

All communication with the game server uses HTTPS encryption.
